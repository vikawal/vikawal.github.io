    <p class="AboutMe">Hello, World! My name is Viktoriia Myshko. <br> I'm Ukrainian. I was born in Kiev and it was a great place to study and enjoy youth. I had great time studying civil law in National University of Internal Affairs. It took 5 years to become a magister. After that my work life began. I've been intern in Ministry of Justice for a while - it was interesting to see how big governmental institutions work.<br> Internship brought me ideas where and how I would like to continue my career. I've decided to become enterpreneur, which brought me not just more challenges, but also a lot of fun: new people, new ideas, finding ways and solutions, a lot of communication. <br> 
  Last years because of family reasons, I've moved to Netherlands and decided to start new professional life here. My mind was set on IT sphere, which in developing bright and gives opportunities to use my experience and soft skills. I like idea, that you can be flexible, work in team and put your efforts in development of something new, fun and useful for a lot of people. <br> I've studied basics of CSS, HTML, JavaScript, testing and project management with a help of gret team of volunteers, who are high-class professionals and simply amazing people. Now I feel ready to start working and bringing to life my knowledge and to help my new team to make our project effective and succesful. <br> See ya soon?  </p>
